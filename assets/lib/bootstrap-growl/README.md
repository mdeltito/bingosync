# Bootstrap Growl
This is a simple pluging that turns standard Bootstrap alerts into "Growl-like" notifications.


## Changelog

- Added onGrowlShow and onGrowlShown callback functionality.

##### Version 1.0.5
- Better positioning when using CSS animations after growl closes.

##### Version 1.0.4
- Updated $.growl() to return a wrapper object with a small API to let you control individual notifications after they have been created.

##### Version 1.0.3

$.growl( { 
  title: 'I have a title', 
  icon: 'glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign', 
  message: 'This growl contains both a Title and a Icon'  
});

$.growl( { 
  title: 'I have a title',  
  message: 'This growl contains both a Title and a Icon',  
});

$.growl('This is an Informational Notification!', { type: 'info' });
$.growl('This is an Successful Notification!', { type: 'success' });
$.growl('This is an Warning Notification!', { type: 'warning' });
$.growl('This is an Danger Notification!', { type: 'danger' });

// Version 1.0.4 //
// Create growl and assign return to variable //
var $growl = $.growl('This is a basic growl! That will not close automatically', { delay: 0 } );

// Create Timeout to close growl since delay is set to 0 //
setTimeout(function() {
	$growl.alert('close');
}, 1000);

// Alert User when Growl is Closing //
$.growl('This Growl will alert the user that it is closing!', { 
	onGrowlClose: function() {
		alert('I am Closing');
	}
});

// Alert User when Growl is Closed //
$.growl('This Growl will alert the user after it has been closed!', { 
	onGrowlClosed: function() {
		alert('I am Closed');
	}
});
